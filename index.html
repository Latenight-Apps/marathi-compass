    <h1>Privacy Policy for Compass App</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 9, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Compass App, developed by <strong>Latenight Apps</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Compass App ("the App"). The App provides a compass and level tool using device sensors, with direction labels in Hindi.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Compass App does not collect, store, or share any personal information or user data. The App operates entirely offline and uses only the following device sensors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accelerometer:</strong> To detect device orientation for the level feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Magnetometer:</strong> To determine direction for the compass feature.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No data from these sensors is stored, transmitted, or shared with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The App uses sensor data solely to provide real-time compass and level functionality. This data is processed locally on your device and is not saved or sent to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data with third parties, as no personal or sensor data is collected or stored by the App.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks that collect data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. It complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>As the App does not collect or store any data, there are no specific security measures required for data protection. The App operates securely within the Android system's permissions framework.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page, and the effective date will be revised accordingly.</p>
